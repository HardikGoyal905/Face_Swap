#### Input --> The photos are stored in the “photos” folder and the videos are stored in the “videos” folder in the same directory of the code.
#### Result --> The result is all the combinations of swapped videos between the photos and the videos, all stored in the new folder “result” formed after execution of code.
#### Lets say we have 5 photos and 6 videos with us, then the result will be having 5*6 = 30 face swapped videos, 5 faces swapped over 6 videos.
